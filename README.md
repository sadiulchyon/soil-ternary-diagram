# Soil Ternary Diagram

An interactive USDA soil texture classification tool built with React and Vite primarily for helping my GGIS103 Lab course students clearer understanding.

Click anywhere on the ternary diagram to get the soil texture class (e.g. Clay, Loam, Sandy Loam) based on the percentage of clay, silt, and sand at that point.
